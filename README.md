# cryptoencrypt
A beginner-friendly Python project for encrypting and decrypting messages using random key generation. This project demonstrates fundamental cryptographic concepts, error handling, and secure data encryption techniques.
# Features
Random Key Generation: Automatically generates a secure, random 32-character key for encryption.
Encryption: Encrypts a user-provided message and displays the cipher text along with the generated key.
Decryption: Decrypts a cipher text using a user-provided key and checks for validity.
Error Handling: Handles invalid keys and mismatched inputs, ensuring secure operations.
